            <h2>Why Nelspruit?</h2>
            <h3>Nelspruit</h3>
            <p>
              Nelspruit, now known as Mbombela, is located on the banks of the
              Crocodile River and is the capital of Mpumalanga. This central
              "Hub of the Lowveld", a term coined in 1934, has grown rapidly in
              the last two decades from a rural town to an urban city and is now
              home to the provincial government buildings on the outskirts to
              the North of the inner city. Only 330km from Johannesburg, less
              than an hour's flight, and 110km from the Lebombo Border control,
              this is the gateway to the Lowveld and Mozambique Corridor. Its
              surfacing is rooted in the development of a railway line. First
              the railway to Lorenço Marques (Maputo) and Delagoa Bay and later
              the railway to Graskop (Pilgrim's Rest).
            </p>
            <p>
              When surveyors were looking for the best way to the Mozambican
              port city, their initial thought was via the escarpment. But after
              meeting the Nel brothers in the area of the creek (spruit) who had
              extensive knowledge of the area due to their annual grazing
              migration, that idea was abandoned and recommendations were made
              to change the route. After an investigation, the recommendations
              were accepted and published in the Government Gazette on 28 August
              1884. Nelspruit was officially proclaimed and this is therefore
              its official founding date. Just to the north of Nelspruit the
              traveler will pass through the charming farming community, the
              town of WhiteRiver (Witrivier) which bears the name of the river
              that flows through it.
